## Setup & Installation

GigMate runs on macOS, Linux and Windows (WSL). For development, Python 3.8+ is recommended.

### **System Requirements**
   - **Python:** 3.8 or newer
   - **pip:** Python package manager
   - **PostgreSQL:** Installed locally or accessible remotely
   - **VSCode or preferred IDE**
   Tip: Verify Python and pip:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   pip3 --version
   ```

### **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lillieharlow/GigMate.git
   cd GigMate
   ```

### **Install Dependencies**
   Create .venv and activate.
   Install pinned dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
### **Set Up PostgreSQL**
   Open PostgreSQL shell
   macOS:
   ```bash
   psql
   ```
   Linux/WSL:
   ```bash
   sudo -u postgres psql
   ```
   Create database (if needed)
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE database_name;
   \c database_name;
   ```

### Create User & Grant Permissions
   ```sql
   CREATE USER user-name WITH PASSWORD 'password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE database_name TO user_name;
   GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO user_name;
   \q
   ```

### Create `.env` and `.flaskenv` files
   Create your own `.env` file and define your DATABASE_URI.
   See `.env.example` DATABASE_URI example
   
   Create your own `.flaskenv` file and define:
   ```bash
   FLASK_APP = main
   FLASK_DEBUG = 1
   ```

### Run the API
Drop, create and seed demo data from `cli_controller`.
```bash
flask db drop
flask db create
flask db seed
```
Run the server:
```bash
flask run
```

API available at: **http://127.0.0.1:5000**

## Hardware Requirements
- **Minimum:** 1 CPU core, 1 GB RAM, small SSD
- **Recommended:** 2+ CPU cores, 2‚Äì4 GB RAM
<hr>

## Dependencies
The full list is in `requirements.txt`. Key packages include:

| Library | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Flask | Web framework and CLI |
| Flask-SQLAlchemy | DB integration for Flask |
| SQLAlchemy | ORM layer used by models |
| marshmallow | Serialization & validation |
| marshmallow-sqlalchemy | Schema generation for models |
| python-dotenv | Load `.env` files for local dev |
| psycopg2-binary | Postgres driver (install on your server only) |

Notes:
- `requirements.txt` in this repo was trimmed to top-level packages; transitive dependencies will be installed automatically by pip.
- If you are running tests, you will need to install `pytest` seperately (this is not listed on `requirements.txt`).

### Purpose of Key Dependencies
- App wiring: Flask & Flask-SQLAlchemy
- Persistence: SQLAlchemy, database drivers (psycopg2 for Postgres)
- Validation/serialization: Marshmallow + marshmallow-sqlalchemy
- Local convenience: python-dotenv
- Production server: gunicorn
- CLI & signals: click, blinker
- Templating & security: Jinja2, MarkupSafe, itsdangerous

### Legal & Ethical Impacts
- All libraries are open-source with permissive licenses.
- No external analytics, or tracking code is included.
- Developers should review licenses if integrating into proprietary software.

### Security Impact
- Environment variables must be used for secrets (DB credentials, API keys).
- Never commit sensitive credentials to version control.
- Test/seed data is included for demos; production databases should enforce TLS/SSL.

### Conflicts
- Use a virtual environment to prevent package conflicts.
- Pin versions in requirements.txt to ensure consistency across environments.
- Avoid mixing global Python packages with the virtual environment.
