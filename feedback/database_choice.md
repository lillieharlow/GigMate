PostgreSQL is a great choice for GigMate because it keeps data safe and accurate — the most important thing for a ticketing system. When many people try to book at the same time, PostgreSQL’s transaction system makes sure bookings don’t get lost or duplicated (so seats aren’t accidentally double-sold).

Why pick PostgreSQL for GigMate?

- Reliable under load: PostgreSQL uses ACID transactions and MVCC to keep data consistent when many users act at once. That means operations like creating and confirming bookings behave predictably even under concurrency.
- Flexible data support: it handles traditional tables and also flexible fields via JSONB, so we can store structured booking data and optional metadata (like third-party IDs or tags) without redesigning the schema.
- Powerful queries and analytics: SQL features like JOINs, window functions and CTEs make it easy to implement availability checks, reporting, and analytics.
- Extensible and cost-effective: Postgres has useful extensions and is free/open-source, so GigMate can grow without upfront licensing costs.

In short: PostgreSQL gives GigMate the safety of a relational database (to protect bookings) combined with features that let the project grow and adapt.

SQL Databases Comparison

| Feature | PostgreSQL | MySQL | MSSQL Server |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Data Types | Rich: JSON, arrays, custom types | Basic set | Broad support, T-SQL features |
| Transactions & Concurrency | ACID, MVCC (strong) | ACID | ACID, enterprise features |
| Extensibility | High (extensions, procedural languages) | Limited | Moderate, proprietary features |
| Advanced queries | Full (CTEs, window functions) | Good | Full (enterprise features) |
| Cost & Licensing | Open-source, free | Open-source | Commercial (paid) |

PostgreSQL offers expressive queries, robust constraints, flexible JSON support, and no licensing costs, providing strong community backing and a feature-rich platform for both today’s and tomorrow’s needs.

NoSQL Databases Comparison

| Feature | PostgreSQL (JSONB) | MongoDB | Cassandra |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Data Model | Relational + JSONB | Document (JSON-like) | Wide-column (high throughput) |
| Transactions | ACID (within SQL) | Limited multi-document | Tunable, usually eventual |
| Querying | SQL + JSON operators | Aggregation framework | CQL (limited joins) |
| Scaling | Vertical + replicas; sharding options | Horizontally scalable | Highly distributed / horizontal |

While MongoDB or Cassandra are good for scale and flexibility with unstructured data, they usually trade off strong consistency—important for bookings where overselling must never occur. PostgreSQL offers a blend of relational control with JSON flexibility, robust enough for a booking system like GigMate.

PostgreSQL’s mix of power, reliability, extensibility, and no-cost open-source licensing make it the top choice for GigMate’s structured, integrity-driven event platform. It excels at preventing booking errors, supports analytics, and can grow with future requirements—all without the cost or limitations of many alternatives.
