**Why GigMate uses PostgreSQL**

- Reliable under load: PostgreSQL ensures data consistency with ACID transactions. This means bookings are safe and accurate, even when multiple users try to book at the same time.

- Flexible yet structured: You can start with simple relational tables for users, events, and bookings, and later add more flexible fields if needed.

- Powerful queries: PostgreSQL supports JOINs, aggregations, and complex queries, making it easy to check availability, generate reports, and analyze data.

- Cost-effective and extensible: It’s open-source and supports extensions, so GigMate can grow without licensing costs.

In short: PostgreSQL keeps GigMate’s data safe, reliable, and ready to grow.

**SQL Databases Comparison**

| Feature | PostgreSQL | MySQL | MSSQL Server |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Data Types | Rich: JSON, arrays, custom types | Basic set | Broad support, T-SQL features |
| Transactions & Concurrency | ACID, MVCC (strong) | ACID | ACID, enterprise features |
| Extensibility | High (extensions, procedural languages) | Limited | Moderate, proprietary features |
| Advanced queries | Full (CTEs, window functions) | Good | Full (enterprise features) |
| Cost & Licensing | Open-source, free | Open-source | Commercial (paid) |

PostgreSQL offers expressive queries, robust constraints, flexible JSON support, and no licensing costs, providing strong community backing and a feature-rich platform for both today’s and tomorrow’s needs.

**NoSQL Databases Comparison**

| Feature | PostgreSQL (JSONB) | MongoDB | Cassandra |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Data Model | Relational + JSONB | Document (JSON-like) | Wide-column (high throughput) |
| Transactions | ACID (within SQL) | Limited multi-document | Tunable, usually eventual |
| Querying | SQL + JSON operators | Aggregation framework | CQL (limited joins) |
| Scaling | Vertical + replicas; sharding options | Horizontally scalable | Highly distributed / horizontal |

While MongoDB or Cassandra are good for scale and unstructured data, they trade off strong consistency. Important for bookings where overselling must never occur. PostgreSQL offers a blend of relational control with JSON flexibility, robust enough for a booking system like GigMate.

PostgreSQL’s reliability, extensibility, analytics power, and free licensing make it the top choice for GigMate. It prevents booking errors, supports reporting, and can scale with the platform’s future needs.
